# Phase 1: GitHub Gist Integration Experiment

## Goal
Create a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the ability to update an Excalidraw scene via GitHub Gist integration.

## Scope
- Single Excalidraw scene loaded from Gist
- Manual calendar data input (no API integration yet)
- Basic time block visualization
- Single job schedule (simplified from final product)

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- GitHub Gist API
- Excalidraw JSON format
- Simple text editor for data input

## Technical Tasks

### 1. Gist Setup
- Create initial template Gist with:
  - Basic Excalidraw scene JSON
  - README with usage instructions
  - Example data format

### 2. Update Mechanism
- Implement Gist read/write functions
- Handle JSON parsing/formatting
- Manage Gist versioning

### 3. Testing
- Manual testing with sample data
- Verify Gist updates
- Document any limitations or issues

## Success Criteria
- Ability to load scene from Gist
- Correct JSON formatting
- Successful Gist updates
- Shareable via Gist URL
