A tool that combines schedule entries from multiple files and creates a unified calendar view.

## Schedule Entry Format

```

```

- Examples:
  ```
  Meeting @ 1:00pm
  Call @ 10:30am
  ```

### Date Format (Optional)
- Add date after time using `on [day] [month-day]`
- Day can be abbreviated (mon, tues, wed, etc.)
- Examples:
  ```
  Meeting @ 1:00pm on mon 3-25
  Call @ 10:30am on tues 3-26
  ```

### Examples

Client meeting @ 11:00am on wed 3-27
Daily standup @ 9:00am on thurs 3-28
```
